# I have updated with remote monitoring the training part 
# you have to go through this page https://github.com/CleanPegasus/TensorDash
# Install TensorDash app in mobie phone 
# Create the user id and password 
# install tensor-dash using pip 
# Clone the git hub page - https://github.com/CleanPegasus/TensorDash ( install the setup file ) 
# Give model name and email id 
# It will ask for password [NOTE: password should be same as tensordash app password]
